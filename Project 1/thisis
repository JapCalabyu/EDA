If you're using GitHub Desktop, the process is even simpler! Here's how to create project folders and push them to your repository:

1. Clone Your Repository
If you haven't already cloned your repository to your computer, follow these steps:

Open GitHub Desktop.

Go to File > Clone Repository.

Select your repository from the list of repositories.

Choose the local folder where you want to clone the repository and click Clone.

Now, your repository is cloned to your local machine, and GitHub Desktop will open it.

2. Navigate to Your Repository Folder Locally
Open File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac).

Go to the local folder where the repository was cloned. You should see the repository folder (e.g., EDA, Dashboard, or Data-Cleaning).

3. Create Project Folders
Now you can create folders for each project:

Open the repository folder (e.g., EDA/).

Inside the repository folder, create new folders for each project. You can create these folders just like any other folder on your computer. For example:

project_1/

project_2/

project_3/

You can do this by right-clicking inside the repository folder and selecting New Folder (or using your computer’s file system to create folders).

4. Add Files to Your Project Folders
Add your project files to the respective folders. For example:

In project_1/, add your Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb), scripts (.py), datasets, or other project-related files.

Repeat this for the other project folders.

5. Commit the Changes Using GitHub Desktop
Once you’ve added the folders and files, you need to commit the changes to GitHub.

Go back to GitHub Desktop.

You should see the changes listed under the "Changes" tab (it will show the new folders and files you've added).

At the bottom of the "Changes" tab, type a commit message (e.g., "Add project folders and files").

Click the Commit to main button (or whichever branch you're working on).

6. Push the Changes to GitHub
After committing the changes locally, push them to GitHub:

In GitHub Desktop, click the "Push origin" button at the top to push your changes to GitHub.

Go to your GitHub repository page in the browser to confirm the changes. You should see the newly created folders and files in your repository.

That’s it! Using GitHub Desktop makes it pretty easy to handle the entire process of creating folders, committing changes, and pushing them to GitHub.
